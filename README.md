# `retch-http`, Node.js bindings for Retch

`retch-http` is a Node.js module that provides bindings for the [Retch](https://github.com/retch-http/retch) library.

It allows you to switch the TLS fingerprints and the HTTP headers of your requests, while still using the same API as the built-in (since Node.js 18) `fetch` function.

## Installation

```bash
npm install retch-http
```

Installing the root package (`retch-http`) with the package manager of your choice will also install the correct prebuilt binary for your platform.

### Compatibility

| Operating System | Architecture | libc implementation | Prebuilt binaries available | 
|--|--|--|--|
| Linux | x86_64 | glibc | ✅ |
| Linux | x86_64 | musl | ✅ |
| macOS | x86_64 | N/A | ✅ |
| Windows | x86_64 | N/A | ✅ |
| macOS | arm64 | N/A | ✅ |
| Windows | arm64 | N/A | ✅ |
| Linux | arm64 | glibc | ❌* |
| Linux | arm64 | musl | ❌* |

*The prebuilt binaries for Linux on arm64 are WIP and not available on npm yet. You can build the package from sources in this repository.

## Usage

```typescript
import { Retcher } from 'retch-http';

// Set up the Retcher instance
const retcher = new Retcher({
    browser: "Chrome", // or "Firefox"
    proxyUrl: "http://localhost:8080",
    ignoreTlsErrors: true,
});

// Use the `fetch` method as you would with the built-in `fetch` function
const response = retcher.fetch("https://example.com");

console.log(response.status);
console.log(response.headers);
console.log(await response.text());
// console.log(await response.json());
// ...
```
